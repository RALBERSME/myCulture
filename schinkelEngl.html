        Karl Friedrich Schinkel was one of the most influential architects and
        master builders of classical modernism in Germany.<br /><br />
        The son of a preacher, he began drawing and painting at an early age,
        entered the Berlin Academy of Fine Arts in 1803, and later worked under
        architects such as Friedrich Gilly. His career flourished after joining
        the Prussian Royal Building Authority; he designed government and
        theater buildings, halls of fame, and monuments.<br />
        Schinkel combined architectural clarity with a Romantic-classicist
        aesthetic and significantly shaped the image of Berlin in the 19th
        century.<br /><br />
        His works range from classicist urban expansions to neo-Gothic elements;
        he was also a painter, draftsman, and design theorist. His work includes
        theaters, museums, and residential buildings, as well as designs for
        palace construction. He died shortly before his 60th birthday.

        Karl Friedrich Schinkel studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in Berlin.
        He pursued a wide range of subjects, including painting, architecture,
        and ornamentation. Schinkel was influenced by Neoclassical ideals,
        combined with a Romantic sensibility for ornamentation and historical
        styles. He practiced a Neoclassical architectural style, later
        incorporating Neo-Gothic influences. He always strived for a clear
        formal language and a harmony of function and aesthetics. He received
        his commissions primarily from the Prussian crown, royal authorities,
        and theater and museum administrations. Among other projects, he carried
        out construction projects for King Frederick William III and later
        rulers.

        Die wichtigsten seiner Bauwerke sind der Neptunbrunnen (Berlin, eine
        monumentale Brunnenanlage mit klassizistischen Formen, vereint
        Mythologie und städtische Repräsentation), ferner das Schinkelsche
        Nationaltheater (heute Staatsoper Unter den Linden, Berlin, eine
        Neoklassizistische Fassung mit zentraler Achsenführung, klarer
        Raumabfolge und Fassade), als auch das Schlossmuseum (heute Altes
        Museum, Berlin, ein Museumsbau im klassizistischen Stil, Säulenhalle,
        räumliche Monumentalität). Auch die Friedrichswerdersche Kirche (Berlin,
        ein neogotischer Kirchenbau mit gotischen Arkaden betont Vertikalität)
        und der Bau der Museumsinsel (Teilprojekte, Planung und Realisierung von
        musealen Odyssee-Raumstrukturen, die das 19. Jahrhundert prägen) stammen
        von ihm.

      <div class="more">
        Schinkel primarily painted and drew in the early years of his career,
        mostly until the 1810s. After 1820, he concentrated predominantly on
        architecture, designs, and design theory rather than on independent
        painting. <br /><br />
        Among his most important paintings are: his self-portrait (around 1815),
        and "The Divine Order," a symbolic composition with clear forms that
        shows the connection between architecture and nature. There are also
        various sketchbooks and designs for scientific and artistic studies that
        visualize architectural concepts, often with concise lines. <br /><br />
        Schinkel was primarily an architect; his artistic works are
        predominantly in the design and planning field rather than in the
        classical painting format.

          Schinkel is considered a pioneer of modern architecture, focusing on
          function, clarity, and a sensitive approach to historical context. His
          influence on museum and public buildings lies in his ability to
          combine historically designed structures with contemporary use. His
          main focus was on the connection between art and science. This
          resulted in an architecture that unites aesthetics, technology, and
          ideology. His legacy shapes monument preservation and the urban
          landscape, particularly in Berlin, where his aspiration to design
          cultural institutions as cultural and historical spaces is clearly
          evident.
