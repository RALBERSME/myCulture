              <h1>Franz Marc</h1>
              <br />
              <h2>
                Franz Marc was born on February 8, 1880, in Munich and died on
                March 4, 1916, near Brangle in France. From an early age, Marc
                developed an intense interest in drawing and nature. He
                initially began studying architecture but quickly turned to
                painting because he was more fascinated by the visual aspects of
                form.
                <br />
                He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, where he
                absorbed the influence of the young avant-garde movements and,
                as part of the Munich Blue Heron Group, later together with
                artists such as Kandinsky, approached Expressionism. He
                developed a preference for clear forms, reduced colors, and a
                monumental visual language that used nature and the animal world
                as central motifs. Central to him was the idea of revealing a
                deeper spiritual reality through abstract, simplified forms and
                giving the image a clear inner order.
                <br />
                <br />
                Among his most important approaches is the introduction of
                stylized animal figures, especially the horse, in intense,
                luminous colors. His paintings strive for a harmonious, often
                spiritual perception of the world, in which colors function as
                symbols of the soul. While his early works were influenced by
                naturalism, he soon developed an expressive, almost iconic
                visual language.
                <br />

                His most famous works include the animal paintings and reduced
                color studies of the Blue Rider group. Works such as « The Blue
                Horses » (1911) and « Landscape with Red House » (1913) are
                considered milestones of Expressionist painting because they
                combine emotional intensity with a new, geometric clarity. Marc
                made a significant contribution to the development of German
                Expressionism. His short but influential career ended tragically
                during the First World War.<br /><br />The videos on the left
