            <h4>About Patience</h4>
            <br />
            <p>
              You must allow things<br />
              their own, quiet,<br />
              undisturbed development,<br />
              which comes from deep within<br />
              and cannot be pushed<br />
              or rushed by anything,<br />
              everything is maturing - and<br />
              then giving birth...
              <br /><br />
              Maturing like the tree,<br />
              that does not press its sap<br />
              and stands confidently in the storms of spring,<br />
              without fear<br />
              that behind it no summer<br />
              could come.<br />
              <br />
              It is coming after all!
              <br />
              But it only comes to the patient,<br />
              who are there as if eternity<br />
              lies before them,<br />
              so carefree, quiet, and wide...<br />
              <br />
              You must be patient<br />
              with what is unresolved in the heart,<br />
              and try to love the questions themselves,<br />
              like locked rooms,<br />
              and like books written<br />
              in a very foreign language<br />
              <br />
              It is about living it all.<br />
              When one lives the questions,<br />
              one may perhaps gradually,<br />
              without realizing it,<br />
              on some strange day<br />
              live into the answers.<br />
