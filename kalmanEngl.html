      <h2>
        Emmerich Kálmán:<br />
        The king of operetta melodies
      </h2>
      <br /><br />
      He was born on October 24, 1882, in Siópál (now Sopron, Hungary) and died
      on October 30, 1953, in Lindau on Lake Constance. His father was a
      musician and choirmaster, and his mother was a dedicated soprano. Even as
      a child, Kálmán showed a keen ear for dramaturgy, rhythm, and tonal
      colors.
      <br /><br />
      He studied music at the Budapest Conservatory, where he specialized in
      composition and music theory. He began his professional career as an
      arranger and conductor, later writing his own pieces for the stage. In the
      1910s, he finally established himself as one of the leading composers of
      the European operetta scene.
      <br /><br />
      Kalmán blended Hungarian folk melodies with Viennese operetta sounds,
      combining catchy melodies with exotic colors. His style is characterized
      by dazzling waltz and foxtrot rhythms, shimmering sounds, memorable
      refrains, and an elegant, often romantic harmony. He worked closely with
      librettists, so that the protagonists and the comedic elements in the
      music were organically intertwined.
      <br /><br />

      The operetta "The Csárdás Princess" (1915) was a turning point in Kalman's
      work. It combined Circassian-Hungarian folklore with Austrian-Viennese
      operetta sound. The catchy melodies, the sparkling rhythmic changes, and
      the power of the emotional moments made it an international hit,
      catapulting him into the top ranks of operetta composers.
      <br /><br />
      Probably his most famous work is "Countess Mariza" (1924). The interplay
      of a passionate love story and a lively, vibrant stage production, carried
      by striking arias and choral pieces, brought Kalmán worldwide fame.
